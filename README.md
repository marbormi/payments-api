# payments-api
Prommt technical assessment. Simple API to manage (CRUD) payments.

## Challenge
```text
Please implement a simple Web application that will support the 4 typical CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete)
Since Prommt is about online payments, we propose you to implement these 4 APIs

1) Create a payment
2) Get details of a payment by its ID
3) Update a payment by its ID (mark it as paid)
4) Delete the payment by its ID (if not paid)

The frontend will contain a small Angular 15 application (no need any wonderful design) that will make use of the previous APIs.
The backend will be based on Spring Boot 3, Java 17, H2 memory DB

Payment entity could contain the following details: 

ID, 
created_date, 
payer_email, 
status, 
currency, 
amount,  
paid_date

Please provide the instructions to execute the application both for FE and BE.
```
